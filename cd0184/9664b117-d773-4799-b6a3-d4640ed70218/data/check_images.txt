Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
VGG: Classified Dog_01.jpg as a golden retriever.
ResNet: Classified Dog_01.jpg as a golden retriever.
AlexNet: Classified Dog_01.jpg as a golden retriever.
Yes, all three models classified Dog_01.jpg as the same breed (golden retriever).

2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: 
VGG:
    Dog_01.jpg: golden retriever.
    Dog_02.jpg: golden retriever.

ResNet:
    Dog_01.jpg: golden retriever.
    Dog_02.jpg: golden retriever.

AlexNet:
    Dog_01.jpg: golden retriever.
    Dog_02.jpg: tub, vat (incorrect classification).

3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer:
VGG:
    Frog_01.jpg: Correctly classified as a tree frog (not a dog).
    coffee_mug.jpg: Correctly classified as a soup bowl (not a dog).

ResNet:
    Frog_01.jpg: Correctly classified as a tree frog (not a dog).
    coffee_mug.jpg: Correctly classified as a soup bowl (not a dog).

AlexNet:
    Frog_01.jpg: Correctly classified as a tree frog (not a dog).
    coffee_mug.jpg: Correctly classified as consomme (not a dog).

Answer: Yes, all models correctly classified Frog_01.jpg and coffee_mug.jpg as not being dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
VGG was the most accurate in classifying dogs (100% accuracy in dog classification).
Although all models classified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as the same breed (except AlexNet, which misclassified Dog_02.jpg), VGG was consistent in its performance.
VGG also performed best in classifying non-dog images (100% accuracy in non-dog classification).
Overall, VGG demonstrated balanced and accurate performance across all categories.
